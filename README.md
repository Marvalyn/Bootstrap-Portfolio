# Bootstrap-Portfolio

## Description
This project is a revamped version of a fully functional webpage for my own professional portfolio. This version of the webpage has very similar styling to it's predecessor but now it uses Bootstrap navbars and cards to optimise it for desktop, laptop, tablets and mobile phones.

This project is focused on showcasing my work and talents as a developer, while also showing my personality through colours and design choice. The code for this webpage closely follows accessibility standards by using alt attributes for all img elements.

## Installation

The webpage can be accessed using any web browser on any device (desktop, laptop, tablet, mobile) however, using Google Chrome on a desktop or laptop is recommended.

## Usage
